# Herdr

Herdr organizes terminals into workspaces, tabs, and panes, recognizes coding agents running inside panes, and exposes the current session through the `herdr` CLI.

Before issuing any control command, verify that this agent is running inside a Herdr-managed pane:

```bash
test "${HERDR_ENV:-}" = 1
```

If the check fails, say that you are not running inside Herdr and stop. Do not inspect or control the focused Herdr session from outside Herdr.

When the check passes, the `herdr` binary in `PATH` talks to the current session. Use it to inspect neighboring work, create terminal layout, start agents and commands, read output, and wait for state changes.

## Learn the current CLI

The installed binary is the authority for command syntax. Start with:

```bash
herdr --help
```

Then print the relevant command group by running the group without a subcommand:

```bash
herdr agent
herdr pane
herdr workspace
herdr tab
herdr worktree
herdr terminal
herdr notification
herdr integration
herdr session
herdr machine
```

Do not run bare `herdr` for discovery; it launches or attaches the TUI. Do not probe a mutating nested command by omitting arguments. Commands such as `herdr workspace create` are valid with defaults and will execute.

Most control commands return JSON. Read identifiers and state from those responses instead of predicting them.

Read the reference file that matches the job:

- `references/layout-and-agents.md` — choosing between workspace/tab/pane commands and agent commands; agent lifecycle states.
- `references/ids-and-caller-context.md` — public ID formats, `HERDR_PANE_ID`, and addressing the caller's own pane.
- `references/agent-coordination.md` — starting an agent in a sibling pane, sending prompts, waiting, and reading results.
- `references/pane-commands.md` — running ordinary commands (tests, servers, shells) in another pane.
Provenance and local changes: `references/upstream.md`.

## Safety and coordination rules

- Use `--no-focus` for background work unless the user asked to switch context.
- Use `--current`, an explicit pane ID, or a unique agent name. Do not rely on another client's focused pane.
- Parse IDs from JSON responses. Do not derive them from sidebar order or examples.
- Do not close workspaces, tabs, panes, or sessions you did not create unless the user explicitly asked. Ordinary CLI/API closes do not inherit the TUI's last-pane confirmation. `workspace close --group` closes the primary workspace and its linked worktree workspaces; never add it merely to bypass `workspace_group_close_required`.
- Use `--trust-repository` only after the user has verified the repository. It grants per-request Git trust; it is not a routine retry for a failed worktree command.
- Client and server versions can differ after an update. Check `herdr status` before relying on new server features. A missing method is not permission to stop or upgrade a server.
- Never run `herdr server stop` from an active session unless the user explicitly intends to stop the server and its pane processes.
- Never kill the main Herdr process. Use named test sessions for experiments that need an isolated server.
- CLI server errors are JSON on stderr with exit status 1. CLI syntax errors exit with status 2.
