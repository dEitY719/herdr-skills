# Layout, panes, and agents — extracted from SKILL.md (verbatim upstream text)

## Understand layout, panes, and agents

Choose the primitive that matches the job:

- Workspace, tab, and pane topology organize terminal locations.
- Pane commands control raw terminals, shells, tests, servers, input, and output.
- Agent commands control the recognized coding agent currently occupying a pane.

A pane exists whether or not it contains an agent. `agent start` requires an existing available shell pane and never creates, splits, or moves layout. Use pane commands for ordinary processes. Use agent commands when Herdr must validate agent identity or interpret `idle`, `working`, `blocked`, `done`, and `unknown` lifecycle states.

Agent commands accept either a unique live agent name or the pane ID currently hosting that agent. They do not accept terminal IDs or bare agent-kind labels. Names must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}` and be unique among live agents. A name follows the current pane occupant and is cleared when that agent exits, is released, or is replaced. Suspending an agent with Ctrl+Z and running a non-agent command preserves its identity while the exact process remains alive. This does not preserve the original identity across another recognized agent taking over. A retained identity does not mean the agent is in the foreground; inspect the pane before sending input.

`idle` and `done` normally indicate the agent is ready for input; neither guarantees that an unfamiliar approval dialog was recognized or that a retained agent is in the foreground. The CLI/API uses the server's seen state to distinguish them; explicit focus commands mark the target seen, while reads do not. Each TUI client tracks viewed completions independently, so its Done badge can differ from the CLI or another client's badge. Antigravity and Grok can be idle while background tasks or subagents keep running, so a settled-state wait is not proof those jobs have finished. `blocked` means Herdr recognized an approval or question UI. `unknown` means an agent is present but Herdr cannot classify it confidently; it does not prove completion.
